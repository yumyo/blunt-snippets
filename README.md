Blunt Snippets
==============

WordPress Plugin that let's you embed any HTML, CSS, JavaScript or PHP snippet into content and widgets using shortcodes.

This plugin works best if the Advanced Custom Fields plugin by Elliot Condon is installed and active.

Create a code snippet then copy and paste the shortcode to wherever you need to embed it...

... rather than altering the editors to allow adding code directly into the content editor or text widget.

See readme.txt for more information
