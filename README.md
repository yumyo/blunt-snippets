Blunt Snippets
==============

WordPress Plugin that let's you embed any HTML, CSS, JavaScript or PHP snippet into content and widgets using shortcodes.

This plugin requires that the Advanced Custom Fields plugin by Elliot Condon be installed and active.

Create a code snippet then copy any paste the shortcode to wherever you need to embed it...

... rather than altering the editors to allow adding code directly into the content editor or text widget.
