Please note that this plugin is design to work with the [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) plugin. It is possible to use this plugin without that ACF, please read the [Other Notes](http://wordpress.org/plugins/blunt-snippets/other_notes/) section for additional information.

With or without ACF this is a no frills plugins.

You can really enter anything you want as a snippet... so you should be careful. The main reason for making this plugin no-frills and making it uses shortcodes that must be copy/pasted is that you need to take specific steps to add anything. You can't just willy-nilly paste stuff into the content of your site.
